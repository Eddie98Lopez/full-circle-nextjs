## Full Circle Brewing Web Concept

I am not, nor have I ever been affiliated with Full Circle Brewing Co. This is a concept, portfolio, web-project inspired by Full Circle Brewing Co.'s existing brand. It is built with React.js in the Next.js framework. I wanted to use this project as an oppotunity to explore a real life, fully custom designed, mobile-friendly, and production level project. It is still a work in progress and I am exploring animations and micro-iteractions to engage the user.

## Design

I designed the UI layout using Full Circle's branded visual assets and other assets I felt aligned with their visual identity. For example the brick background in the "featured beers" section was inspired by the painted brick wall they have in their taproom and the mural they have in their patio area. The crumpled paper background was inspired by concert posters due to their frequent live music events. I added these textures because I felt it aligned with their alt, almost grungy visual aesthetic.

I did research on a multitude of other craft brewing company websites for layout, UI design, and micro-interaction inspiration. I then wireframed in Adobe XD to help me organize my design decisions and plan out components for the development process. I did not add prototyping functionality to the wireframes because I knew I would be the sole designer and developer for this project.

## Development

This React.js project utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering and a mix of CSS modules and Tailwind for styling. Some notable components are the "featured beers" and a "blog" section, although the data is currently hardcoded and intended to be fetched from an API in the future. I am working to build all components for reusability and mobile friendliness.

Some new things I learned on this project were:
- useRef Hook
- snap-scroll-type
- Intersection Observer API
- Tailwind and CSS Modules (I had always styled with style-components almost exclusively until now)
- Some basic parallax implementations 
- animated SVGs

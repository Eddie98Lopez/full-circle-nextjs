## Full Circle Brewing Web Concept

I am not, nor have I ever been affiliated with Full Circle Brewing Co. This is a concept, portfolio, web-project inspired by Full Circle Brewing Co.'s existing brand. It is built with React.js in the Next.js framework. I wanted to explore micro-interactions and animations. This project is still a work in progress.

## Design

I designed the UI with references and inspiration from their established visual identity and branded touch points. I did not design the brand or the visual or video assets. I designed the UI with branded visual assets as well as other assets I felt aligned with their visual identity. For example the brick background in the "featured beers" section was inspired the painted brick wall they have in their taproom and the mural they have in their patio area. The crumpled paper background was inspired by concert posters due to their frequent live music events. I added these textures because I felt it aligned with their alt almost grungy visual aesthetic and it paired well with their custom fonts.

I also looked at other brewing company websites for UI layout and styling ideas. I am a big fun of Firestone Brewing's website.

## Development

This project is built with React.js in the Next.js framework. Next version 14.0.1. I chose to build with the Next.js framework because of SEO benefits for a local business and wanted to make the project feel as real as possible. I wanted to explore what a real website project for a local business would look like. And tried to build similar components that explore custom styling, micro-interactions, animations, etc. I also wanted to make sure that I designed keeping mobile friendliness in mind.

Some new things I learned on this project were:
- useRef Hook
- snap-scroll-type
- Intersection Observer API
- Tailwind and CSS Modules (I had always styled with style-components almost exclusively until now)
- Some basic parallax implementations 
- animated SVGs
